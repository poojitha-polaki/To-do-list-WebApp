# 📝 To-Do List Web Application
This is a simple, responsive To-Do List built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The key feature of this application is its persistence: your tasks are automatically saved and restored using the browser's Local Storage, meaning your list remains intact even after you close or refresh the page.

## ✨ Features
1.Task Persistence: All tasks are saved automatically in your browser's Local Storage.

2.Check/Uncheck: Easily mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

3.Deletion: Remove tasks with a simple click on the 'x' icon.

4.Responsive Design: The layout is optimized for all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, and desktop).

5.Progress Tracking: Includes a visual progress bar and a task count to show your completion status.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Functionality and Local Storage management)
